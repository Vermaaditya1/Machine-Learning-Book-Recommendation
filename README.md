# Machine-Learning-Book-Recommendation

This project implements a book recommendation system using a combination of popularity-based and collaborative filtering techniques. The system analyzes book ratings to provide recommendations, visualizes data on book publications and authors, and determines the most popular books.

### Usage
Data Preparation: Ensure you have the necessary data files (books.csv, users.csv, ratings.csv) in the same directory as the notebook.

Execution: Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to preprocess the data, perform analyses, visualize results, and generate book recommendations.

### Libraries Used
The notebook utilizes the following Python libraries:

1) numpy: Numerical operations.
2) pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
3) seaborn: Statistical data visualization.
4) matplotlib: Plotting and visualization.
5) sklearn: Machine learning and similarity computations.
